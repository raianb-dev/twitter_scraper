### Question 1

1. Describe which are the main challenges to implement a scraper in social media
platforms as Instagram, You Tube and Tik Tock. Give at least 4 examples of
challenges, explain why you believe that are an issue and present which
methods you would use to handle it. If do you believe there is some challenges
that cannot be solved, please provide the reason to support your point of view.

R: The main challenge in implementing a web scrap on social networks is the
privacy policies and url that are not allowed for scraping present
in robots.txt files, and would handle this issue using libraries and
tools, and algorithms that do not violate the privacy policy rights,
I believe that every challenge can be solved, but it can take time.

### Question 2

2. What do you understand by Data Mining? How this concept can be used to the
mission to develop platform the support business to find the best Influencer to
increase the ROI of their marketing actions. 

R: Data mining is used to detect patterns and predict or presuppose results. 
This can help a marketing company find the best influencer by analyzing a 
particular user and their frequency of posts and interactions.

### Question 3

3. web scraping tasks. If you already use some of them, please describe the
solution you create. 

R: Task devOps no but, I've already created web scrap projects about: Currency quotation, Free government data,
emails and online casinos.

### Question 4

4.Explain what HTTP is and how it works. Also, provide a brief description of
methods, headers, and cookies in the HTTP context.

R: HTTP requests is used for communication between the client and the server,
an HTTP request has headers, it can have a body and ssl certificate, 
there are 4 types of http requests: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE. 
Cookies can be manipulated through http requests, they are used most of
the time to track certain user actions on the website.

### Question 5

5. What do you understand by Proxies Servers and why their important for the web
scraping process? 

R: It is important that proxies are high performing, whitelisted and
credential authentication, HTTP(S) and SOCKS5 supported.

### Question 6

6. Differentiate Machine Learning, artificial intelligence, and data science.

R: The difference is that data science works with data analysis and prediction through 
statistical techniques, while AI and Machine Learning implement extraction models
to predict future events through programmable algorithms.

### Question 7

7. In the Machine Learning context, what is Feature Engineering ? Why this is
important for Machine Learning Processing and how the Data Engineering cam
interfere on that ? 

R: Feature Engineering deals with the data source. Data Engineering is responsible for collecting,
gathering and preparing a company's data so that it can be worked on on other fronts,
such as Data Analytics, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
Not choosing a good data source can interfere with the model projection result.

### Question 8

8. Differentiate the Data Scientist from the Data Engineering ?

R: the data scientist provides clear metrics to solve business problems, the data engineer develops, 
tests and maintains the data structure for the data scientist.

### Question 9
